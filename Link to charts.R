##Below is a link to my plot.ly account
##There you will find graphics for my project 

## "Financial Scatter"is comparative time series plots to show a created
## index that I made with other REITs over the past 2 and half years or
## so

##"Pandas-polar-chart" is an adaptation of a polar chart, where the blue
##line is a moving average from the same created index and the scatter
## (pink dots) are a stock price. The time period is 360 days -- which 
## does not include weekends or holidays, so it is a bit more than a year 
## in the trading world 

##Other graphs and datasets were done in the process of me figuring out
##how to make the former two graphs
